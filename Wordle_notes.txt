- Constants in another file so it's easier to change

- Nice scraping, probably better to use beautifulsoup4 and just search for items with 
  the property (itemprop="name")

- You don't want the booting up of the game to be dependent on a successful webscraper, 
  imagine if the format of the website changed, then your scraper would break and the game
  wouldn't start.
  - I sugggest scraping the data and just storing in a .txt file
  - Better yet, you can store the words in a database, it would be a good practice of some sql.
    You could store additional stuff like the length of the words, allowing you to generalise
    the game to more than 5 letters, also updating/changing the list of words would be more
    managable than a .txt file
  - I would put all of this logic in a separate file since this is more back-end logic, the 
    game interface would be front-end logic

- Although it just gets a random word from the list, you could have a cache that stores the
  previous 10 words or something, and use this to guarentee the user doesn't get the same word
  in the next go.

- Would be better to seggregate the code a little more i.e. seperate functions that handle user
  input for a word, a function for validating the inputted word, a function for updating the UI.
  This way, if you wanted to add additional stuff to the game, like different modes with different
  number of letters, maybe a survival mode where you track the score; it will be easier to implement
